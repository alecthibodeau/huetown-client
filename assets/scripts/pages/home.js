          Today April 11th, 2020 I'm participating in 
          <a class="text-link" href="https://unbound.risd.edu" target="_blank">RISD Unbound</a>.
          As part of this celebration of Rhode Island artists, I'll be donating 50% of the proceeds from all online sales today to the 
          newly established <a class="text-link" href="https://www.artistcommunities.org/arf" target="_blank">Rhode Island Artist Relief Fund</a>.
          And all orders placed today will include a free copy of my <span class="bold ital">Fold'em Funnies #1</span> minicomic, 
          currently in the collection of the <a class="text-link" href="https://library.risd.edu" target="_blank">Fleet Library</a> at RISD.
