          On April 11th, 2020 I participated in 
          <a class="text-link" href="https://unbound.risd.edu" target="_blank">RISD Unbound 2020</a>.
          Coinciding with this celebration of local artists I donated 50% of that day's proceeds from every sale at Huetown to the 
          <a class="text-link" href="https://www.artistcommunities.org/arf" target="_blank">Rhode Island Artist Relief Fund</a> &mdash; newly established in response to COVID-19.
          All orders included a free copy of my <span class="bold ital">Fold'em Funnies #1</span> minicomic 
          (currently in the collection of the <a class="text-link" href="https://library.risd.edu" target="_blank">Fleet Library</a> at RISD).

          and enthusiasts from across the region. Through exhibits and sales,
