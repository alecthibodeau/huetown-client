        Huetown is the web shop for artist Alec Thibodeau (me!). 
        I make lunar calendars, prints, postcards and more. An artist's bio 
        and images of my past work can be found at my portfolio site: 
        <a href="https://alecthibodeau.com/about.html" target="_blank">alecthibodeau.com</a>. 
        All items here are printed in the USA.
